### Clustering Methods

    K-Means algorithm can be broken down into following steps:
        1. Randomly initialize cluster centers
        2. Assign each point to the closest center
        3. Compute new center of each cluster
        4. Stop if cluster assignments did not change
        5. Go to step 2

    Args:
        features - Array of N features vectors. Each row represents a feature
            vector.
        k - Number of clusters to form.
        num_iters - Maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.

        assignments - Array representing cluster assignment of each point.
